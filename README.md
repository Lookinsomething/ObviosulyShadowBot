Here are the packages you need for this bot!

[discord-leveling v1.1.0]
[discord.js v13.1.0]
[node-fetch v2.6.1]
[quick.db v7.1.3]

**How do I download?**
1. Open the terminal of the file you're making for the bot
2. Type in npm install <package name> <@version>
Example: npm install discord.js @12.


this only supports discord.js v12.5.3 and not any higher version or older version of it. you may edit the code but if any error were to come out then it's not my fault I specifically tested the code before sending it to you.

other than that thats it. go to the index.js file to copy the code
